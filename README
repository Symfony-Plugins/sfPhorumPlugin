= sfPhorum plugin (for symfony 1.0) =

== Installation ==

Download phorum-5.1.25.zip and unzip

Download the embed module from:

http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?28,53902

Uncompress this module into the 'mods' directory in your phorum directory.

Insert the fixtures.

Look at the app.yml.sample, and you'll see the vendor_path setting that
you will need to add to your applications own app.yml.

=== Layout Changes ===

add to layout within the head section:

{{{
<?php include_title() ?>
<?php
  if (has_slot('sfPhorum')) {
    include_slot('sfPhorum');
  }
?>
}}}

This change will allow sfPhorum to insert things into the head section
of your site, for example RSS links.

=== Enable the module ===

modify settings.yml to this:

{{{
all:
  .settings:
    enabled_modules:        [default, sfGuardAuth, sfPhorumForum]
}}}

== TODO ==

  * grep code for any 'FIXME's
  * alter fixtures so that there's no mention of 'pookey' (the domain name is set
    in there for the forum.. how to solve that?
  * alter schema so that the search index is fulltext
  * do something to allow admin.php access...
  * change the user sync so that only users with permission X are set as administrators

== Changelog ==

=== 2007-10-05 | 0.1 Beta ===

  * pookey: initial release
Nothing to see here yet
